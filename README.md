# Interactive Portfolio Chat

This is a [Next.js, FastAPI](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app). The project serves as an interactive portfolio website that combines a terminal-styled chat interface with AI-powered chat capabilities.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server in the frontend directory:

```bash
npm run dev
```
or
```bash
yarn dev
```
or
```bash
pnpm dev
```

Next, to start the backend server, navigate to the backend directory and run:

```bash
cd backend
uvicorn app.main:app
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
